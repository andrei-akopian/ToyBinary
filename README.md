# ToyBinary

I was so frustrated about python binary being so complicated, that I couldn't play around with it, that I decided to make my own python library for exploring binary.
Obviously this library is really inefficient and is written in python, and should be used only for learning&trying around (that's why it is called toy). If you are planning on writting something that will actually be out there, do yourself a favor and learn C.
